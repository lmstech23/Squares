# Phase 2 Backlog

Deferred work with a reason and a trigger. An entry without a removal
condition is a wish, not a ticket.

## Remove `/volunteer-access` alias route

**Added:** 2026-08-30 (S0, check-in staff rename)
**File:** `src/app/api/host/boards/[id]/volunteer-access/route.ts`
**Delete after:** the first release *following* the S0 deploy — once no
browser can still be holding a pre-rename dashboard bundle.

S0 renamed the host route to `/api/host/boards/[id]/check-in-staff`. A host
dashboard loaded **before** that deploy still holds the old URL in its
JavaScript and will call it afterward, so deleting the old path immediately
would break the create and revoke buttons for anyone with a tab already open.

Both paths call one shared implementation in
`src/lib/check-in-staff-handlers.ts`, so there is no second copy to drift.

**To remove:** delete the route directory. Also drop the
`volunteerAccessId` fallback in `revokeCheckinStaffLink`, which exists for
the same reason and expires at the same moment.

Sign-up addendum §2 is explicit that an alias without a removal ticket is
permanent. This is that ticket.

## Physical rename of `volunteer_access`

**Added:** 2026-08-30 (S0)
**Blocked by:** needs a planned window with no event nearby.

S0 renamed at the application layer only. `schema.prisma` says
`CheckinStaffAccess` while psql says `volunteer_access`, pinned by `@@map`.
Same for `checked_in_by_volunteer_access_id` and `by_volunteer_access_id`.

A physical rename was rejected because production holds issued access records
and check-in logs referencing them, and a rolling deploy would leave old
instances querying an object that no longer exists — a failure that surfaces
at a gate, at an event, in front of a line.

**Either do it in a planned window, or consciously never do it.** Both are
fine. Drifting into it by accident is not.

Note the mapped approach also buys something: any raw SQL or Supabase RPC
still referencing `volunteer_access` keeps working untouched.

## Host row has an empty email

**Added:** 2026-08-30 (S0 verification)
**Row:** `hosts.id = c94cbd1c-b5f9-409f-ae53-efb2a00ddb31` — the host that owns
every current board, including `rpffdlbf` / "Homecoming Fundraising".

`hosts.email` is an empty string. It is `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, so the column
is satisfied and nothing errors today, but:

- **A second host with an empty email cannot be created** — the unique index
  rejects it. `getHost()` upserts `email: user.email ?? user.phone ?? user.id`,
  so a Supabase user with neither email nor phone would collide here.
- Any transactional email keyed off the host address has nowhere to send.
- It is why fixture setup must pin the host by `id`: there is no
  distinguishing field to select on, and `findFirst` would be arbitrary.

**Not fixed here.** Correcting it means writing to a live production row that
owns real boards, which is out of scope for a rename. Needs a deliberate check
of where `hosts.email` is read before it is set.

Observed, not acted on, during S0 fixture planning.
